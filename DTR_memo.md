Project: Little Shop

Group Member Names: Tylor Schafer and Santiago Caraveo

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

We both agree that we don't need to have our 'hands on' every facet of the project, but would like to know how everything works and be able to explain that. We will know we are successful if the project is completed and formatted properly.
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

We are both very versitle in that we work well alone, but have no problem in pair programming where neccessary.
How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

We both like to diagram and plan things out, we plan on using this to get mental images of code before we start writing it. Plan on using time-management to effictively finish tasks.
Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):

We both have wide-open schedule availability, will try to collab on the weekend where neccessary. Also want to meet after class for driver-navagator sessions and to compare our code.
Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

We want to retro after class everyday to review our code and plan our next steps.
Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Tylor: I have decent testing strengths, and have a pretty good understanding of MVC structure.
Santiago: Strengths in problem solving, figuring out solutions.
Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Tylor: Will work on anything.
Santiago: Work on features that focus on things that are currently difficult for me.
Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Want to always make sure we are reviewing each others pull requests before merging. Make sure all features are created on branches. Be open to communicating problems so we can work on them together.
Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Positive and contructive, be specific so feedback is actionablew.
Project management tools we will use:

github projects, slack
